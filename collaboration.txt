Fork and Pull Request Workflow: This method involves creating a personal copy (fork) of a repository, making changes in your forked copy, and then proposing
these changes to the original repository via a pull request. It's ideal for contributing to open-source projects.

Collaborative Branches and Issues: Collaborators within a repository can create separate branches for various tasks or features and use GitHub Issues to
track and prioritize work.This approach fosters teamwork, efficient task management, and code reviews.

Both of these methods are valuable for effective collaboration on GitHub, whether you're contributing to an open-source project or working within
a team on a private repository.
